## Bengali Number Plate Detection Using Edge-Based and Contour-Based Methods
[[Code](https://github.com/tajmaun/Nearest-Important-Place-Visualization)]

Number plate detection plays a significant role in vehicle counting, traffic surveillance, and law enforcement. While many approaches have been proposed for detecting number plates, most focus on Latin-script plates. This thesis presents a novel and effective method for detecting Bengali number plates, addressing the challenges posed by unique script characteristics and real-world variations in plate appearance.

Our system processes generic images, including snapshots taken in natural conditions. We employ Sobel edge detection, Otsuâ€™s thresholding, morphological closing operations, minimum bounding rectangles, and contour properties to localize the number plate. The algorithm has been successfully tested on a diverse set of real-world images.

For character recognition, we use a contour-based segmentation approach combined with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. Experimental results demonstrate **87%** accuracy in plate detection and **70.12%** accuracy in character segmentation, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach for Bengali number plates.
