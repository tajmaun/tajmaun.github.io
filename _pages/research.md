## [Bengali number plate detection using contour properties of locally important regions.]
The Galaxy Wearable Android app manages **Samsung’s RTOS-based smart rings, fitness bands, and WearOS-based smartwatches**, enabling firmware updates (FOTA), notifications, data sync, and device settings through dedicated plugins.

As a core contributor, I developed and optimized key features, including **FOTA(Firmware Over The Air), LBS(Location Based Service), notifications, and log dump functionalities**. I worked extensively on protocol development for **device-app communication, ensuring secure and efficient data exchange.** Additionally, I played a role in refining the user interface to enhance the **user experience** of managing Samsung’s wearable ecosystem.
