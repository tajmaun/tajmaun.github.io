## Number Plate Detection Using Edge-Based and Contour-Based Methods
Number plate detection is a crucial application in vehicle counting, traffic surveillance, and law enforcement. Over the years, numerous algorithms and techniques have been proposed to address this problem. This thesis presents a novel and straightforward approach for detecting number plates in real-world scenarios. Our system is designed to work with generic images, including snapshots captured under realistic conditions.

Our method utilizes Sobel edge detection, Otsuâ€™s thresholding, morphological closing operations, minimum bounding rectangles, and contour properties to accurately localize number plates. The algorithm has been successfully tested on a variety of real-world images.

For character recognition, we employed a contour-based segmentation approach alongside a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. Experimental results demonstrate an **87%** accuracy in plate detection and **70.12%** accuracy in character segmentation, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.
