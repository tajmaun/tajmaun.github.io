## About me
Hi, I'm __Maun__.
I am a software engineer with a deep passion for cutting-edge technologies, including **Wearable devices, Human-computer interaction (HCI), High-performance software development, Distributed system and Cloud computing.** I graduated from the [University of Chittagong, Bangladesh](https://cu.ac.bd/v2/) with a degree in Computer Science and am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/srbd).

With over six years at Samsung Research, I have played a key role in developing **RTOS based smart rings , bands** and **wearOS based smartwatches**, focusing on **designing communication protocols** for seamless device interaction, defining data exchange specifications, and ensuring efficient device-to-app communication over Bluetooth, BLE and other wireless technologies.

Beyond wearable technology, I specialize in writing **optimized, secure, and efficient code** that enhances software performance. I have worked extensively on memory optimization, identifying memory leaks, reducing application size using advanced techniques and tools, and ensuring efficient resource utilization. Security is another critical aspect of my expertiseâ€”I follow best practices to prevent vulnerabilities.I have extensive experience in **Java, C#, Kotlin, Swift, C++, iOS, Android and UWP** which has allowed me to work across diverse platforms and develop robust, scalable applications. My strong theoretical knowledge in distributed systems fuels my passion for designing scalable and resilient architectures, a domain I am eager to explore further in industry, research and academia.I also have a solid background in **competitive programming**, ranking in the **top 1%** in national/international-level contests, which has sharpened my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

## Research and Innovation
My undergraduate thesis in **computer vision and image processing** marked the beginning of my passion for research. My enthusiasm for research has been further fueled by my active involvement in drafting **DOI**  related to wearable devices and applications, where I contributed to the development of novel solutions that bridge the gap between theory and real-world implementation.**I am eager to explore research domains where I can apply my skills and experience to drive meaningful advancements and contribute to cutting-edge innovations.**
