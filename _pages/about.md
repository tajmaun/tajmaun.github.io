## About me
Hi, I'm __Maun__.
I am a software engineer with a deep passion for cutting-edge technologies, including **Wearable devices, Human-computer interaction (HCI), High-performance software development, Distributed system and Cloud computing.** I graduated from the [University of Chittagong, Bangladesh](https://cu.ac.bd/v2/) with a degree in **Computer Science** and am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/srbd).

With over six years at Samsung Research, I have played a key role in developing **RTOS based smart rings , bands** and **wearOS based smartwatches**, focusing on **designing communication protocols** for seamless device interaction, defining data exchange specifications, and ensuring efficient device-to-app communication over Bluetooth, BLE and other wireless technologies.

Beyond wearable technology, I specialize in writing **optimized, secure, and efficient code** that enhances software performance. I have worked extensively on memory optimization, identifying memory leaks, reducing application size using advanced techniques and tools, and ensuring efficient resource utilization. Security is another critical aspect of my expertiseâ€”I follow best practices to prevent vulnerabilities.I have extensive experience in **Java, C#, Kotlin, Swift, C++, iOS, Android and UWP** which has allowed me to work across diverse platforms and develop robust, scalable applications. My strong theoretical knowledge in distributed systems fuels my passion for designing scalable and resilient architectures, a domain I am eager to explore further in industry, research and academia.I also have a solid background in **competitive programming**, ranking in the **top 1%** in national/international-level contests, which has sharpened my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

## Research and Innovation
My undergraduate thesis in computer vision and image processing marked the beginning of my passion for research. My enthusiasm for research has been further fueled by my active involvement in drafting **DOI**  related to wearable devices and applications, where I contributed to the development of novel solutions that bridge the gap between theory and real-world implementation.**I am eager to explore research domains where I can apply my skills and experience to drive meaningful advancements and contribute to cutting-edge innovations.**
