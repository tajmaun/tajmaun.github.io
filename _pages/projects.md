The **Galaxy Wearable Android** app is a companion application for Samsung's wearable devices, including **RTOS based smart rings, fitness bands, and WearOS-based smartwatches**. It enables seamless device management, firmware updates (FOTA), notification handling, and data synchronization. The app provides an intuitive UI for configuring device settings, monitoring health data, and ensuring smooth communication between wearables and smartphones. This includes dedicated plugins for smart RTOS based rings, bands, and WearOS-based smartwatches, allowing tailored functionality for each device category.

**My Role:**
As a core contributor, I contributed to developing and optimizing key features of the Galaxy Wearable app. My responsibilities included implementing FOTA (Firmware Over-The-Air) updates, LBS (Location-Based Services), notification services, and log dump functionalities. I worked extensively on protocol development for device-app communication, ensuring secure and efficient data exchange. Additionally, I played a role in refining the user interface to enhance the user experience of managing Samsung's wearable ecosystem.
