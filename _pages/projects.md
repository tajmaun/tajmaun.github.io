## Galaxy Wearable(Android)
The Galaxy Wearable Android app is a companion application for Samsung's wearable devices, including smartwatches, fitness bands, and earbuds. It enables seamless device management, firmware updates (FOTA), notification handling, and data synchronization. The app provides an intuitive UI for configuring device settings, monitoring health data, and ensuring smooth communication between wearables and smartphones.

**My Role:**
As a Software Engineer, I contributed to developing and optimizing key features of the Galaxy Wearable app. My responsibilities included implementing FOTA (Firmware Over-The-Air) updates, LBS (Location-Based Services), notification services, and log dump functionalities. I worked extensively on protocol development for device-app communication, ensuring secure and efficient data exchange. Additionally, I played a role in refining the user interface to enhance the user experience of managing Samsung's wearable ecosystem.
